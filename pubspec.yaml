  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/img/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
  - family: Poppins
    fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Thin.ttf
        weight: 100      # Thin
      - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Light.ttf
        weight: 300      # Light
      - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Regular.ttf
        weight: 400      # Regular
      - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Medium.ttf
        weight: 500      # Medium
      - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Bold.ttf
        weight: 700      # Bold
      - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-ExtraBold.ttf
        weight: 800      # ExtraBold

  - family: Cairo
    fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/cairo/Cairo-Light.ttf
        weight: 300      # Light
      - asset: assets/fonts/cairo/Cairo-Regular.ttf
        weight: 400      # Regular
      - asset: assets/fonts/cairo/Cairo-Medium.ttf
        weight: 500      # Medium
      - asset: assets/fonts/cairo/Cairo-Bold.ttf
        weight: 700      # Bold
